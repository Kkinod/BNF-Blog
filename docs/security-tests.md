## Authentication Security Tests

As part of enhancing the application's security, a series of tests were conducted to verify the authentication system's resistance to various types of attacks. These tests are part of an ongoing process to improve application security.

### Test Methodology

The tests were conducted using specially prepared scripts simulating timing attacks. These scripts performed a series of requests to the server with different combinations of authentication data:

1. Standard login processes
2. Login attempts with incorrect data
3. Various patterns of interaction with the authentication system

### Test Results

#### Results with Implemented Security Mechanisms

Below are the results of security tests with protective mechanisms in place:

As can be seen in the screenshot above, the system shows high resistance to the analyzed threats. The differences in system behavior between different scenarios are minimal, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the implemented security measures.

#### Example of a System Without Adequate Protection

For educational purposes, below are the test results for a system without appropriate security mechanisms:

The above example illustrates what a security analysis might look like for a system that does not implement appropriate protective mechanisms. Differences exceeding 10% may indicate potential security vulnerabilities.

### Conclusions

The tests conducted showed that the implementation of security mechanisms in the application effectively protects against the analyzed threats:

1. The system consistently behaves in a predictable way regardless of the type of interaction
2. The implemented security mechanisms work correctly
3. Comparison with examples of systems without protections shows the value of the implemented solutions

## API Security Tests: Search Functionality

As part of our commitment to application security, we conducted comprehensive tests on our API endpoints, with a particular focus on input sanitization and XSS protection in the search functionality.

### Test Methodology for XSS Protection

We conducted XSS-focused testing on input fields related to search functionality across publicly exposed API routes:

1. Collection of XSS polyglots from [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/Intruders/XSS_Polyglots.txt)
2. Custom-crafted malicious inputs targeting our specific API structure
3. Automated testing using scripts to attempt various injection techniques

### Test Results

#### Before Implementation of Enhanced Sanitization

Initial testing revealed potential vulnerabilities in our API endpoints:

![API security testing showing 500 errors](https://i.gyazo.com/636f80808d04fd6f0840103ca466f52b.png)

While the application didn't allow successful XSS injections due to existing safeguards, some malicious inputs caused 500 server errors instead of being properly handled, as seen in the screenshot above. This indicated room for improvement in our input sanitization approach.

#### After Implementation of Multi-Layer Sanitization

After implementing a comprehensive sanitization strategy using both sanitization and escaping libraries:

1. All previously problematic inputs are now properly sanitized
2. No more 500 errors occur when processing malicious inputs
3. The API responds consistently with appropriate error messages or sanitized results
4. System stability is maintained even under attack conditions

### Conclusions

The implemented multi-layer sanitization approach significantly improved the security posture of our API:

1. The combination of XSS filtering and regular expression escaping provides robust protection
2. The system now gracefully handles malicious inputs rather than failing
3. Performance impact of the sanitization is negligible
4. The approach follows security best practices while maintaining full functionality

These improvements demonstrate our commitment to following OWASP security guidelines and maintaining a secure application for all users.
