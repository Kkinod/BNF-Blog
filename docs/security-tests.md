## Authentication Security Tests

As part of enhancing the application's security, a series of tests were conducted to verify the authentication system's resistance to various types of attacks. These tests are part of an ongoing process to improve application security.

### Test Methodology

The tests were conducted using specially prepared scripts simulating timing attacks. These scripts performed a series of requests to the server with different combinations of authentication data:

1. Standard login processes
2. Login attempts with incorrect data
3. Various patterns of interaction with the authentication system

### Test Results

#### Results with Implemented Security Mechanisms

Below are the results of security tests with protective mechanisms in place:

As can be seen in the screenshot above, the system shows high resistance to the analyzed threats. The differences in system behavior between different scenarios are minimal, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the implemented security measures.

#### Example of a System Without Adequate Protection

For educational purposes, below are the test results for a system without appropriate security mechanisms:

The above example illustrates what a security analysis might look like for a system that does not implement appropriate protective mechanisms. Differences exceeding 10% may indicate potential security vulnerabilities.

### Conclusions

The tests conducted showed that the implementation of security mechanisms in the application effectively protects against the analyzed threats:

1. The system consistently behaves in a predictable way regardless of the type of interaction
2. The implemented security mechanisms work correctly
3. Comparison with examples of systems without protections shows the value of the implemented solutions
